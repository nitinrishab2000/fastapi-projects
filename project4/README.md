# ✅ Project 4 – FastAPI Todo App with Authentication, Admin Panel & Testing

This is a production-ready **FastAPI-based Todo API** that includes:

- User authentication (mocked, for now)
- Role-based access (User vs Admin)
- CRUD operations for todos
- Admin-level control over all todos
- Database via SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- Dependency injection for cleaner architecture
- Fully tested using Pytest
